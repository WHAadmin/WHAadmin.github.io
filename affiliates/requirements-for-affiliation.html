     <abbr title="World History Association">
      WHA
     </abbr>
     to consider an organization for affiliate status, it must meet these basic standards:
    </p>
    <h3>
     Constitution
    </h3>
    <ol>
     <li>
      All affiliates must have a written constitution which conforms to Article II of the
      <a href="https://www.thewha.org/about/constitution/">
       <abbr title="World History Association">
        WHA
       </abbr>
       constitution
      </a>
      .
     </li>
     <li>
      The constitution must clearly define the organization&rsquo;s purpose and role in promoting world history.
     </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
     Leadership
    </h3>
    <ol>
     <li>
      An affiliate must have an established membership and it must have its own elected officers, consisting at a minimum of a president, vice-president, and secretary-treasurer in order to request affiliation.
     </li>
     <li>
      The membership and leadership structure of each affiliate must include secondary school teachers as well as teachers and scholars from institutions of higher learning, as does the World History Association (
      <a href="https://www.thewha.org/about/constitution/">
       Constitution
      </a>
      , Article V, section 2).
     </li>
     <li>
      While affiliates are autonomous and self-governing, affiliation carries the obligation to maintain cooperative and positive relations with the World History Association. To facilitate doing so, each affiliate will have a representative on a council of affiliates, which will have the power to make recommendation to the Executive Council of the World History Association.
     </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
     Region
    </h3>
    <ol>
     <li>

     How to Become an Affiliate
    </h2>
    <p>
     The following are the necessary procedures for consideration of affiliate status by the
     <abbr title="World History Association">
      WHA
     </abbr>
     :
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      The organization seeking affiliation must send the Executive Council a Letter of Status requesting acceptance of affiliation.
     </li>
     <li>
      Associations must submit statements of support from neighboring affiliates with their requests for affiliation, or at least must demonstrate that they made timely requests for such statements of support.
     </li>
     <li>
      Affiliates formed in the USA are responsible for establishing and maintaining their tax-exempt status at federal and state levels.
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     Interested associations may request affiliate status with the World History Association in conformity with such policies as the World History Association may establish. Such affiliate status becomes effective when approved by two-thirds vote of the Executive Council. The World History Association assumes no financial or legal responsibility for the affiliates. Either the World History Association or the affiliate may terminate the affiliation at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
     The president of the World History Association has the power, from time to time as needed, to review the status of the affiliates collectively or individually and to revise procedures for affiliation. Decisions on these matters will be subject to approval by majority vote in the Executive Council.
    </p>
    <p>

     Bylaws for Affiliates
    </h2>
    <p>
     The formal bylaws for affiliates, as approved by the Executive Council in June 1999, are:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      The World History Association welcomes the formation of regional or topically defined world history associations and encourages their affiliation with the World History Association on the following terms:
     </p>
     <p>
      A letter requesting affiliation must be presented to the Executive Council of the World History Association and accepted by a two-thirds vote.
     </p>
     <p>
      All affiliates must have constitutions. The purpose of each affiliate and its role in promoting world history, as defined in its constitution, must conform to Article II of the Constitution of the World History Association. The membership and leadership structure of each affiliate must include secondary school teachers as well as teachers and scholars from institutions of higher learning, as does the World History Association (Constitution, Article V, section 2).
     </p>
     <p>
      All affiliates must have clearly defined geographical or topical boundaries and must not be geographically competitive with each other. In the request for affiliation, each affiliate must explain and defend its boundaries as appropriate and different from the boundaries of other affiliates. Associations requesting affiliation must submit statements of support from neighboring affiliates with their requests for affiliation, or at least must demonstrate that they made timely requests for such statements of support.
