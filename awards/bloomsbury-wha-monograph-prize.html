     Dr. Corina Gonzalez-Stout, Northwest Vista College
    </h2>
    <p style="font-weight:400">
     Corina Gonz&aacute;lez-Stout is an Associate Professor of History at Northwest Vista College, a Hispanic-serving community college in San Antonio, Texas. She has taught a variety of courses in her 15-year career in higher education, including primary teaching assignments in World History I and II, as well as Mexican American History and U.S. Women&rsquo;s History. Although Dr. Gonz&aacute;lez-Stout has had a passion for teaching that began in the 1990s as a first through third grade public school teacher in San Antonio&rsquo;s southside, she is equally passionate about historical research and scholarship, and is thankful for recent opportunities to engage in this work.
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight:400">
     Dr. Gonz&aacute;lez-Stout earned an M.A. in History from the University of Texas at San Antonio in 2008 and earned a Ph.D. in History from the University of South Africa in 2022 at the age of 50. Her specializations are in southern African history, with her scholarship focusing on themes and topics pertaining to sexuality, gender, race, colonialism, and power relations.
