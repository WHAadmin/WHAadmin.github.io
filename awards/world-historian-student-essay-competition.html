    <p>
     The World Historian Student Essay Competition is an international competition open to students enrolled in grades
     <abbr title="kindergarten through twelfth grade">
      K&ndash;12
     </abbr>
     in public, private, and parochial schools, and those in home-study programs. Membership in the World History Association is not a requirement for submission. Past winners may not compete in the same category again.&nbsp; Finalist essays will be checked against AI internet components and will be automatically disqualified should stock answers be detected.
    </p>
    <p>
     The World History Association established this $500 prize to recognize young scholars. A one-year membership in the WHA will also be included with each prize.
    </p>
    <p>
     Each competitor will submit an essay that addresses one of the following topics and discuss
     <span style="text-decoration:underline">
      how it relates to you personally
     </span>
     and to World History:&nbsp; Your view of a family story related to a historical event or your personal family cultural background, or an issue of personal relevance or specific regional history/knowledge, such as "My ancestor walked with Abraham Lincoln from Illinois to fight in the Black Hawk War of 1832."
    </p>
    <p>
     The committee will judge papers according to the following criteria:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      clear thesis;
     </li>
     <li>
      elaboration on the thesis with specific, concrete, personal example(s);
     </li>
     <li>
      evidence of critical-thinking, such as synthesis and evaluation, when reflecting on the essay question;
     </li>
     <li>
      organization and fluency; and
     </li>
     <li>
      overall effectiveness of the student&rsquo;s ability to communicate his or her personal connection&nbsp;with the study of world history&mdash;in other words, how well has the student described the experience of being changed by a better understanding of world history?
     </li>
