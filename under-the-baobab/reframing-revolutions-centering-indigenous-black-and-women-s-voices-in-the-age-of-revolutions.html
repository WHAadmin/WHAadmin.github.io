     It is easy to replicate dominant perspectives on the &ldquo;Age of Revolutions&rdquo; in ways that marginalize the historical
      agency and influence of people of color, indigenous people, and women. This session highlights strategies and
      materials to support interventions that correct this bias by centering the actions of marginalized people, such as
      indigenous Andeans or enslaved Haitians, complicating the role of the Enlightenment in the Age of Revolution, and
      by incorporating the stories of women as revolutionaries.
