     This forum will offer a roundtable-style discussion considering what an &ldquo;inter-imperial&rdquo; model brings to analyses
      of world history and politics. How does this model complement, challenge, or reconfigure other models
      (comparative, connected, postcolonial, world-system) within the multi-vectored field of empires? What emerges when
      considering the discursive-material legacies of successive empires as co-constituted with the sustaining,
      resisting practices of conscripted peoples? How have aesthetic and knowledge formations interacted with
      political-economic formations to enable justice-seeking transformation&ndash;as well as imperial interpellation?
