        Routledge invites proposals for 100,000 word manuscripts that gender world history for undergraduate and general readers over the next 5 to 7 years. Centering the gendered and sexed body in modern world history uncovers the disciplinary mechanisms that sustain racism and sexism into our own time. From the pulpit to the plantation, from the school to the shop floor, these mechanisms extended their reach over the course of the last three centuries at the level of the intimate and the global. Containment of &ldquo;unruly&rdquo; bodies informs every aspect of society in more and less obvious ways, from family law or policing, to environmentalism or museum curation. Despite its hegemonic nature, periodic resistance against that containment allows for individuals and communities to attain moments of liberation. This series traces the evolution and persistence of both disciplinary mechanisms and liberatory projects and dreams in cross-cultural contexts throughout the modern period.

        This series will provide accessible texts that integrate the latest scholarship for upper-level undergraduate and graduate courses in a variety of fields: History, Gender Studies, Political Science, International Studies, and Sociology/Anthropology.
